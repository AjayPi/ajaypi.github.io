  What is a Stargate Project
  </summary>
  </br>
  <p> Stargate Project has a very specific meaning that is very likely to be different to how projects are defined in your team:</p>
  
<p> A Stargate Project is a group of resources (e.g. Confluence spaces, GitHub organizations, Jira projects, Artifactory repos, etc) where access is controlled, usually to avoid IP contamination. </p>
  
<p> Therefore a single Stargate Project usually contains many engineering projects. But it may be possible for a project to need strict controls over the IP of part of it, and therefore it is possible a single engineering project could be spread over multiple Stargate Projects. </p>
